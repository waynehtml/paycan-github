# smb

Handlers:

- `oedis.handler.smb.download`
- `oedis.handler.smb.upload`

Transfers files between an SMB share and the task inbox using a UNC root plus relative source/destination paths.

## Configuration

### Task parameters (`params`)

| Field | Required | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connection.unc` | Yes | string | — | UNC root path, for example `\\FS01\FinanceShare` or `\\FS01\FinanceShare\Inbound\CORRA`. Must include both server and share. |
| `connection.auth.username` | No | string | — | SMB username passed to `register_session()`. |
| `connection.auth.password` | No | string | — | SMB password passed to `register_session()`. |
| `requests` | Yes | list | — | One or more transfer specs. |

### Download spec (`requests[]` for `smb.download`)

| Field | Required | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src_dir` | No | string | `""` | Remote source directory relative to `connection.unc`. Leave empty to discover from the UNC root. Accepts `test\\abc` or `test/abc`. |
| `include` | No | string or list[string] | `["*"]` | Glob patterns for files to include. Matching is attempted against both the file name and the path relative to `src_dir`. Prefer `recursive: true` with patterns like `"*.csv"` for nested discovery. |
| `exclude` | No | string or list[string] | `[]` | Glob patterns for files to skip after include filtering. Matching is attempted against both the file name and the path relative to `src_dir`. |
| `recursive` | No | bool | `false` | When `true`, recursively walks subdirectories under `src_dir`. |
| `updated_after` | No | string | — | ISO-8601 timestamp. Keeps files with modified time `>= updated_after`. |
| `updated_before` | No | string | — | ISO-8601 timestamp. Keeps files with modified time `< updated_before`. |
| `dst_dir` | No | string | `""` | Local destination subdirectory relative to `ctx.inbox`. Must be relative and must not contain `..`. |
| `delete_source_file` | No | bool | `false` | Deletes the remote SMB file after successful download and local size validation. |

### Upload spec (`requests[]` for `smb.upload`)

If an upload request's source directory is missing while the runtime inbox is
valid, the request is logged at INFO and skipped. Empty directories and filters
matching no files also succeed with zero uploads. Other requests continue normally.
Invalid source paths, permission errors, and subsequent listing or transfer errors
still fail. Connection setup is unchanged and may fail even when no files exist.

| Field | Required | Type | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dst_dir` | No | string | `""` | Remote destination directory relative to `connection.unc`. Leave empty to upload directly into the UNC root. |
| `src_dir` | No | string | `""` | Local source directory relative to `ctx.inbox`. Must be relative and must not contain `..`. |
| `include` | No | string or list[string] | `["*"]` | Glob patterns for local files to include. Matching is attempted against both the file name and the path relative to `src_dir`. Prefer `recursive: true` with patterns like `"*.csv"` for nested discovery. |
| `exclude` | No | string or list[string] | `[]` | Glob patterns for local files to skip after include filtering. Matching is attempted against both the file name and the path relative to `src_dir`. |
| `recursive` | No | bool | `false` | When `true`, recursively discovers local files under `src_dir`. |
| `delete_source_file` | No | bool | `false` | Deletes the local source file after successful upload and remote size validation. |

## Behavior notes

- `connection.unc` must be a valid UNC path beginning with `\\` and must include both server and share.
- Download `src_dir` and upload `dst_dir` are resolved relative to `connection.unc`. Empty values resolve to the UNC root.
- Download `dst_dir` and upload `src_dir` are resolved relative to `ctx.inbox`. Empty values resolve to `ctx.inbox`.
- Download `dst_dir` and upload `src_dir` must be relative local paths. Absolute paths and paths containing `..` are rejected.
- Download matching uses SMB file modified time. Upload matching uses local file name and relative path only.
- Time filtering applies only to `smb.download`: `updated_after <= mtime < updated_before`.
- If `recursive=false`, only the immediate directory entries are considered.
- If `recursive=true`, subdirectories are traversed and `include` and `exclude` are matched against both file names and paths relative to `src_dir`.
- Preferred style: use `recursive: true` with `include: ["*.csv"]` rather than `include: ["**/*.csv"]`.
- Downloads and uploads always keep the path relative to the resolved source root under the resolved destination root.
- The handler detects path collisions before transfer:
  - download fails if multiple remote files would resolve to the same local path
  - upload fails if multiple local files would resolve to the same remote path
- Download verifies that the local file exists, is a regular file, and matches the expected remote size after transfer.
- Upload verifies that the remote file size matches the local file size after transfer.
- Upload automatically creates missing SMB destination folders.
- Transfers use Python stream copy via `shutil.copyfileobj()`.
- The handler returns a standardized `TaskResult` structure documented in [`TASK_RESULTS.md`](../TASK_RESULTS.md).

## Outputs

Each transferred file produces one output entry like:

```json
{
  "src": {
    "type": "file",
    "path": "\\\\FS01\\FinanceShare\\Inbound\\CORRA\\rates\\daily.csv",
    "size": 1234,
    "mtime": "2026-03-19T08:15:00"
  },
  "dest": {
    "type": "file",
    "path": "/local/inbox/download/rates/daily.csv",
    "size": 1234
  },
  "duration_sec": 0.214
}
