# storage

Handlers:
- `oedis.handler.storage.download`
- `oedis.handler.storage.upload`

Copies files with `dbutils.fs.cp` between Databricks-supported storage paths and the task inbox.

## Common behavior

### Task fields

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `connection.uri` | Yes | none | Remote base path or URI used for every request in the task. Examples: `/Volumes/...` or `abfss://...`. |
| `requests` | Yes | none | One or more transfer request specs. |

### Common request fields

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `include` | No | `["*"]` | Glob pattern or list of glob patterns to include. Use `recursive: true` with patterns like `"*.csv"` for nested discovery. |
| `exclude` | No | `[]` | Glob pattern or list of glob patterns to exclude after include filtering. |
| `recursive` | No | `false` | Walk subdirectories under the resolved source root. |

Notes:
- `include` and `exclude` accept either a string or a list of strings.
- `recursive=false` considers only files directly under the resolved source root and matches `include` and `exclude` against file names.
- `recursive=true` also traverses subdirectories and matches `include` and `exclude` against both file names and paths relative to the resolved source root.
- Preferred style: use `recursive: true` with `include: ["*.csv"]` rather than `include: ["**/*.csv"]`.
- Request `src_dir` and `dst_dir` values must be relative when provided. Absolute paths, full URIs, and paths containing `..` are rejected.
- Empty strings and omitted values resolve directly to the applicable base root.
- Matched files always keep their path relative to the resolved source root under the resolved destination root.

## storage.download

Copies files from remote storage into the task inbox.

### Download resolution

- Remote source root = `connection.uri + src_dir`
- Local destination root = `ctx.inbox + dst_dir`

### Download request spec

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src_dir` | No | `""` | Remote source directory relative to `connection.uri`. Empty or omitted means use `connection.uri` directly. |
| `dst_dir` | No | `""` | Local destination directory relative to `ctx.inbox`. Empty or omitted means use `ctx.inbox` directly. |
| `include` | No | `["*"]` | Glob pattern or list of patterns to include. Use `recursive: true` with patterns like `"*.csv"` for nested discovery. |
| `exclude` | No | `[]` | Glob pattern or list of patterns to exclude after include filtering. |
| `recursive` | No | `false` | Walk subdirectories under the resolved remote source root. |

### Download example

```json
{
  "id": "transfer-storage-to-staging",
  "handler": "oedis.handler.storage.download",
  "params": {
    "connection": {
      "uri": "/Volumes/main/raw"
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "src_dir": "partners",
        "recursive": true,
        "include": ["*.parquet"],
        "dst_dir": "staged/inbound"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## storage.upload

If an upload request's source directory is missing while the runtime inbox is
valid, the request is logged at INFO and skipped. Empty directories and filters
matching no files also succeed with zero uploads. Other requests continue normally.
Invalid source paths, permission errors, and subsequent listing or transfer errors
still fail. Connection setup is unchanged and may fail even when no files exist.

Copies files from the task inbox into remote storage.

### Upload resolution

- Local source root = `ctx.inbox + src_dir`
- Remote destination root = `connection.uri + dst_dir`

### Upload request spec

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `src_dir` | No | `""` | Local source directory relative to `ctx.inbox`. Empty or omitted means use `ctx.inbox` directly. |
| `dst_dir` | No | `""` | Remote destination directory relative to `connection.uri`. Empty or omitted means use `connection.uri` directly. |
| `include` | No | `["*"]` | Glob pattern or list of patterns to include. |
| `exclude` | No | `[]` | Glob pattern or list of patterns to exclude. |
| `recursive` | No | `false` | Walk subdirectories under the resolved local source root. |

### Upload example

```json
{
  "id": "transfer-staging-to-storage",
  "handler": "oedis.handler.storage.upload",
  "params": {
    "connection": {
      "uri": "abfss://oedatastore@lakeanalyticsprd01.dfs.core.windows.net/curated"
    },
    "requests": [
      {
        "src_dir": "download",
        "dst_dir": "partners",
        "recursive": true,
        "include": ["*.parquet"],
        "exclude": ["*_tmp.parquet"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
