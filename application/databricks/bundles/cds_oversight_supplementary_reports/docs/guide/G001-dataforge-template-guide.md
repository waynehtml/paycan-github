# DataForge Template Project Guide

**DataForge** is the Databricks template project used to start standardized OEDS/DataBridge data engineering solutions.

The template provides a ready project shape for Databricks Asset Bundles, workflow orchestration, ingestion, transformation, Unity Catalog delivery, release operations, validation assets, and AI-assisted development. A new project should begin by copying this bundle, initializing project-specific configuration, then replacing the sample workflow pieces with real dataset logic.

This guide is an overview. It explains why the template exists, what components it contains, and how those components fit together. For step-by-step setup instructions, use the related guides linked at the end.

## DataBridge naming

DataBridge is the current name for the ingestion project and service formerly
called DIS/OEDIS. The sibling source project is stored in
`application/databricks/bundles/databridge`, and DataForge keeps its
synchronized contract snapshot under `docs/reference/databridge`.

Compatibility identifiers remain unchanged, including the `oedis` Python
package, `oedis.handler.*` handler and schema contracts, `DisClient` APIs,
DIS-prefixed variables, and OEDIS-named deployed infrastructure.

## Purpose

DataForge exists to make new Databricks data projects consistent from the first commit.

It gives developers a common foundation for:

- Databricks Asset Bundle deployment
- Environment-specific project configuration
- Dataflow, curation, integration, service, and operation workflow jobs
- DataBridge-backed ingestion
- Landing, raw, standardized, and curated processing stages
- Shared notebook runtime context
- Reusable Python workflow utilities
- Packaged configuration for schemas, permissions, email, files, file loading, and timeseries
- Unity Catalog table, view, and permission delivery
- Release and maintenance notebooks
- Examples
- the agent prompts and skills that follow the project structure

The goal is not only to copy files faster. The goal is to reduce project-to-project variation so projects are easier to review, operate, enhance, and hand over.

## Design Principles

DataForge follows a few practical rules:

- Keep deployment configuration in bundle files and resource files.
- Keep workflow orchestration in `jobs`.
- Keep shared runtime setup in `common.py`.
- Keep reusable project code in `src/oeds/domain`.
- Keep operational configuration packaged under `conf/oeds/config`.
- Keep examples, tests, releases, and tools separate from production workflow tasks.
- Prefer extending existing registries, managers, and utility patterns before adding a new project-specific pattern.

These rules help both human developers and AI coding tools produce changes that are easy to locate and review.

## Project Lifecycle

A typical project starts from this sequence:

1. Copy `application/databricks/bundles/dataforge` to a new sibling folder.
2. Rename the copied folder to the intended project or dataset name.
3. Create `databricks.yml` from `default.databricks.yml`, adjacent comment mappings, and confirmed project-specific values.
4. Align [common.py](../../common.py) fallback defaults with the generated bundle values.
5. Replace sample config and task logic with real dataset behavior.
6. Add or update schema, permission, email, fileloader, and timeseries config as needed.
7. Validate the Databricks Asset Bundle and project-specific tests before deployment.

The copied folder name normally becomes the bundle name. The initialized
`databricks.yml` becomes the project-specific deployment descriptor.
`/init-project` runs once: after all initialization validation succeeds, it
removes only the copied `default.databricks.yml`. Legacy domain YAML files, if
present, remain untouched and are not initialization inputs. The canonical
DataForge template keeps its default YAML. Later
configuration changes edit project YAML directly and keep `common.py` fallbacks
aligned; initialization stops if `databricks.yml` already exists.

## Runtime Flow

The template provides `DATAFLOW`, `CURATION`, `SERVICE`, and `OPERATION` job
definitions. Each resource file declares its purpose and required status in
leading comment metadata. SERVICE is required and included automatically. The
developer may select any subset of the other three optional jobs, including
none. Project initialization automatically enables any future job marked required. Future
resource files under `resources/jobs` automatically become additional choices.

`DATAFLOW` is the dataset pipeline. It is organized as a gated flow:

1. `task_00_main.py` builds context and prepares the run.
2. `task_10_ingest.py` calls DataBridge.
3. `task_20_land_to_raw.py` moves landed files into raw storage.
4. `task_30_raw_to_std.py` is the raw-to-standardized extension point.
5. `task_40_std_to_curated.py` is the standardized-to-curated extension point.
6. `task_50_integrate.py` is the downstream-integration extension point.
7. `task_90_on_complete.py` handles successful completion or controlled early exit.
8. `task_91_on_failure.py` handles failure notification.

`CURATION` is a gated curated-layer job that runs independently from
`DATAFLOW`. It validates shared inputs, optionally checks dependencies, runs
the project curation task, and optionally runs project integration. Successful,
disabled, controlled-completion, and failed paths reach the shared curation
lifecycle handlers.

When Job Setup is enabled, its final step selects compute for enabled jobs from
the default YAML choices. Independent App Setup follows before validation and
source-template cleanup; disabled job files stay unchanged.

`SERVICE` is required when Job Setup is enabled. It can run release notebooks, utility notebooks, or named task notebooks by passing a task name or notebook path through job parameters.

`OPERATION` is a fixed single-task job for project-owned work that needs its own
job identity. It does not dispatch arbitrary notebook paths. Projects that
enable it must replace its successful no-op placeholder with the intended
operation logic.

Every enabled job receives common base parameters from [resources/jobs/common.yml](../../resources/jobs/common.yml) through its definition in [resources/jobs](../../resources/jobs). Those parameters are read by [common.py](../../common.py), which gives notebooks one shared runtime context.

## Configuration Model

DataForge keeps project configuration outside task notebooks whenever possible.

Packaged configuration lives under [conf/oeds/config](../../conf/oeds/config):

- `ingest`: DataBridge ingestion request templates.
- `datafile`: file definitions, schemas, and reader options.
- `fileloader`: file-to-table load mappings.
- `schema`: Unity Catalog table and view definitions.
- `permission`: catalog, schema, table, and view grant rules.
- `email`: email registry entries and HTML templates.
- `timeseries`: provider, dataset, series, and publishing metadata.

The bundle treats `conf` as a Python source root and imports these areas
through `oeds.config.<area>`.

Reusable managers and utilities live under [src/oeds/domain/utils](../../src/oeds/domain/utils). The intent is for project notebooks to call these utilities instead of embedding large blocks of configuration or orchestration logic directly in notebooks.

## Deployment Configuration

The template is initialized from:

- `default.databricks.yml`
- adjacent domain mapping comments in the default and enabled resource YAML
- explicit or confirmed inferred project values

The initialized output is `databricks.yml` in the project root. That generated
file defines bundle identity, includes the shared and job-specific resource
files, and configures variables, targets, environment-specific overrides,
workspace paths, service principals, notification emails, Databricks workspace
references, DataBridge job IDs, and Datamart endpoints. The job common file declares
the three job variables and stores domain/target values in `mapping`
comments beside each variable declaration. Initialization populates its target variables from each selected variable mapping;
every included job uses those resolved values.

General setup always runs, followed by independent Job and App setup choices.
Declining either skips its inputs and resources; declining both is supported.
The generated include list is explicit. When jobs are enabled, it includes
`resources/jobs/common.yml` and every job whose metadata
marks it required and only the optional jobs selected during initialization; it
never uses the `resources/jobs/*.yml` wildcard.

Required project identity, resource naming, and raw-path inputs are initialized
once in the complex `project` variable. The `{{team}}`, `{{domain}}`,
`{{tag}}`, `{{catalog}}`, `{{dataset}}`, and `{{raw_path}}` placeholders live
only in `default.databricks.yml` and are resolved from explicit or confirmed
inferred values. Each initialization placeholder has adjacent `name`,
`description`, `required`, and `value` comment metadata. The `value` metadata
lists its allowed resolution modes and only the applicable options, inference
rule, or optional input example. An example is not a default. `project.domain`
selects matching entries in adjacent comment mappings case-insensitively.

Workspace roots, catalog names, volume paths, and antivirus paths retain their
shared derivations. The five shared settings `app_secrete_scope`, `secrete_scope`,
`service_spn_id_key`, `service_spn_secrete_key`, and `email_mappings` instead use
literal `mapping` comments beside their declarations in
`default.databricks.yml`. General setup resolves them automatically, even without
jobs or apps. Scope mappings contain one scalar per domain, resolved into the
variable default inherited by all targets. SPN keys and email mappings retain
domain/target entries. Changing project.tag does not change these values. Email mappings
remain JSON strings. Target metadata and unrelated target overrides remain in the main configuration.
Job identity, alerts, and permissions use adjacent mappings in
`resources/jobs/common.yml` only when jobs are enabled.

Each job resource file begins with `purpose` and `required` selection metadata
and owns required name and description placeholders with the same initialization
comment schema. Their `infer` rules produce uppercase
`<DOMAIN>-<DATASET>-<JOB-TYPE>` names and `<dataset> <job-type> job`
descriptions. Their `input` mode lets a project provide either complete value
without enforcing the inferred name structure; initialization uppercases the
complete job name while preserving the description. Initialization asks only
for enabled job identities, so disabled resource files remain unchanged.

After `databricks.yml` is created, [common.py](../../common.py) must be aligned with the same project values so direct notebook runs and tests do not fall back to stale template defaults.

## AI-Assisted Development

The template includes shared agent instructions and task skills:

- [Project instructions](../../AGENTS.md)
- [.agents/skills](../../.agents/skills)
- [DataKit API reference](../reference/datakit/README.md)

Use these files when asking an agent to initialize a project, maintain configuration, or extend the template. Read the applicable AGENTS.md files and linked skills before making changes.

## What Developers Usually Customize

For a real project, the common customization points are:

1. Project identity and deployment variables in generated `databricks.yml`.
2. Matching fallback defaults in `common.py`.
3. Ingestion requests under `conf/oeds/config/ingest`.
4. File and file load definitions under `conf/oeds/config/datafile` and `conf/oeds/config/fileloader`.
5. Schema definitions under `conf/oeds/config/schema`.
6. Permission rules under `conf/oeds/config/permission`.
7. Email registry and templates under `conf/oeds/config/email`.
8. Timeseries registration config under `conf/oeds/config/timeseries`, when needed.
9. Task-specific notebook logic in `jobs/dataflow`, `jobs/curation`, and
   `jobs/operation`.
10. Release, example, and test assets that prove the project behavior.

The `DATAFLOW` transformation placeholders are `task_30_raw_to_std.py` and
`task_40_std_to_curated.py`. Its integration placeholder is
`task_50_integrate.py`. `CURATION` retains its separate `task_20_curate.py` and
`task_30_integrate.py` entry points. The two workflows do not share task
implementations.
